# VMware-Fusion-Uninstaller

### This is for Uninstalling VMware Fusion on macOS

#### Applications create with Platypus 5.3 base on [uninstall_vmware.sh](https://gist.github.com/pwnsdx/8bf29a7e87a78addc3a3db5f08c197f8)

### Very useful considering that there is a lot of files to install

- What is also very useful is that after trying it for a few days, you uninstall it, then reinstall VMWare and it's like you've never used it.
